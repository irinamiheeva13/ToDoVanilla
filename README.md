# ToDo in vanilla JS 

![Gif](todo-js.gif)

### This project represents my skills in native JavaScript. One of the challengies was to interact with DOM in a correct way. 

#### Technologies Used:

As for the HTML and styling I kept it simple - the main focus of the project is on JavaScript.

Instead of gulp I tried new package manager Yarn.
